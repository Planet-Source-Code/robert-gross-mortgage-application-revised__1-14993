## Mortgage Application Revised


</div>

### Description

This is a revision of the Mortgage Application that I had submitted earlier that i found to have some errors when loading it into Visual Basic. So hopefully this one will not have that problem. this particular application does not require Microsoft Excel to generate the amortization table like my earlier application.
 
### More Info
 
Just input the Loan amount, interest rate, and the length or term of the loan.

Will provide the monthly payment and if the amortization command button is pressed, you will see a FlexGrid table.
